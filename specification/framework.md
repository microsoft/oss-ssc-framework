# Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the core concepts of the Open Source Software (OSS) Secure Supply Chain (SSC) Framework to outline and define how to securely consume OSS dependencies, such as NuGet and NPM, into the developer&#39;s workflow. For the purposes of this Framework, we define OSS as any source code, language package, module, component, container, library, or binary that you can consume into your software project as a dependency that does not have a paid-support contract. This guide provides a dedicated framework to enhance any organization&#39;s OSS governance program to address supply chain threats specific to OSS consumption.

OSS has become a critical aspect of any software supply chain. Across the software industry, developers are using and relying upon OSS components to expedite developer productivity and innovation. However, attackers are trying to abuse these package manager ecosystems to either distribute their own malicious components, or to compromise existing OSS components.

This paper is split into two parts: a solution-agonistic set of practices and a maturity model-based implementation guide. The practices section should be utilized by individuals like Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and security, engineering, compliance/risk managers while the implementation guide should be utilized by software developers and other security practitioners.

This paper presents:

- An overview of the Microsoft OSS SSC Framework Practices.
- Common supply chain threats with examples and how OSS SSC Framework can help.
- An overview of the OSS SSC Framework Implementation Guide and Maturity Model.
- A process for assessing your organization&#39;s maturity.
- Detailed walkthrough of the OSS SSC Framework implementation requirements and tools.
- A mapping of the OSS SSC Framework requirements to other specifications.

The guidance provided in this paper is targeted toward organizations that do software development, that take a dependency on open source software, and that seek to improve the security of their software supply chain.

# About the Microsoft OSS SSC Framework

The OSS SSC Framework is a security assurance and risk reduction process that is focused on securing how developers consume open source software. As a Microsoft-wide initiative since 2019, the OSS SSC Framework provides security guidance and tools throughout the developer inner-loop and outer-loop processes that have played a critical role in defending and preventing supply chain attacks through consumption of open source software across Microsoft. Using a threat-based risk-reduction approach, the goals of the OSS SSC Framework are to:

1. Provide a strong OSS governance program
2. Improve the Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR) for resolving known vulnerabilities in OSS
3. Prevent the consumption of compromised and malicious OSS packages

The Microsoft OSS SSC Framework (described later in this document) is modeled after three core concepts—_control all artifact inputs, continuous process improvement, and scale._

![](RackMultipart20220804-1-5ey4ri_html_252fe04e0f2802f3.png)

- _Control All Artifact Inputs_: There are a myriad of ways that developers consume OSS today: git clone, wget, copy &amp; pasted source, checking-in the binary into the repo, direct from public package managers, repackaging the OSS into a .zip, curl, apt-get, git submodule, and more. Securing the OSS supply chain in any organization is going to be near impossible if developer teams don&#39;t follow a uniform process for consuming OSS. Enforcing an effective secure OSS supply chain strategy necessitates standardizing your OSS consumption process across the various developer teams throughout your organization, so all developers consume OSS using governed workflows.
- _Continuous Process Improvement_: To help guide organizations through continuous process improvement, we have organized the OSS SSC Framework into a maturity model. This helps organizations prioritize which requirements they should implement first. Since security risk is dynamic and new threats can emerge at any time, the OSS SSC Framework places heavy emphasis on understanding the new threats to the OSS supply chain and _requires_ regular evaluation of OSS SSC Frameworkcontrols and introduction of changes in response to new technology advancements or new threats.
- _Scale_:The Microsoft OSS SSC Framework tools were designed with scale in mind. Some organizations may attempt to secure their OSS ingestion process through a central internal registry that all developers within the organization are supposed to pull from. However, what if one developer chooses to pull straight from pypi.org or npmjs.com? Is there anything preventing them from doing so? A central internal registry also has the problem of requiring a team to manage the process and workflow, which is extra overhead. As such, Microsoft&#39;s OSS SSC Framework tools were developed to secure how they consume OSS today at scale without requiring a central internal registry or central governance body.

# What is the OSS SSC Framework?

The OSS SSC Framework is a combination of requirements and tools for any organization to adopt. The Framework includes a capability maturity roadmap to help establish a secure OSS ingestion process to protect developers from OSS supply chain threats and to establish a strong governance program to manage your organization&#39;s use of OSS.

# Common OSS Supply Chain Threats

The Microsoft OSS SSC Framework was designed based on known threats (i.e. tactics and techniques) used by adversaries to compromise OSS packages. The table below is a comprehensive compilation of OSS supply chain threats with links to real examples. It also identifies which OSS SSC Framework requirements mitigate the threat. To see the full list of requirements and their benefits, please see the [OSS SSC Framework Requirements](#oss-ssc-framework-requirements) later in this document.

# OSS SSC Framework Practices

## Target Audience

This section is a solution-agonistic description of what should be implemented to secure your organization&#39;s OSS supply chain. The guidance is useful to compliance/risk managers, security managers, engineering managers, and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs).

## OSS SSC Framework Practices

### _Practice 1: Ingest It_

_I can ship any existing asset if external OSS sources are compromised or unavailable._

**Sample threat scenarios addressed by this job:**

- The Docker Hub repository becomes compromised
- A team might be targeted by a dependency confusion attack
- Azure itself is unavailable and we need access to OSS assets to restore it
- A package becomes permanently unavailable (i.e. left-pad is removed)

The first step towards securing a software supply chain is ensuring you control all the artifact inputs. To satisfy this practice, there are two ingestion mechanisms: one for packaged artifacts and one for source code artifacts.

For **packaged artifacts**, we require ingestion into an artifact stores – Linux package repositories, artifact stores, OCI registries – to fully support _upstream sources_, which transparently proxy from the artifact store to an external source and save a copy of everything used from that source. When using a mix of internal and external packaged artifacts, it is important to secure your package source file configuration to protect yourself from dependency confusion attacks ([CVE-2021-24105](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-24105)).

For **source code artifacts**, we require mirroring external source code repositories to an internal location. Mirroring the source in addition to caching packages locally is also useful for many reasons:

- Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) purposes, so that your organization can take ownership of code if a critical dependency is removed from the upstream
- Enables proactive security scans to look for backdoors and zero-day vulnerabilities
  - Enables your organization to contribute fixes back upstream
- Enables your organization to perform fixes if needed (in extreme circumstances)

### _Practice 2: Scan It_

_I know if any OSS artifact in my pipeline has vulnerabilities or malware._

**Sample threat scenarios addressed by this job:**

- A team tries to use an OSS package with a known vulnerability
- A team is already using an OSS package believed to be secure, but a new vulnerability in that package is later publicly disclosed
- A team tries to use an OSS package that is known to steal bitcoins (i.e. the _event-stream_ scenario)
- A team tries to use an OSS package with a backdoor

Once we control all artifact inputs, we must scan all inputs to trust them. This trust is built using scanners that look for vulnerabilities, malware, malicious or anomalous behavior, extraneous code, and other known or previously undiscovered issues (i.e. zero-day vulnerabilities).

### _Practice 3: Inventory It_

_I know where OSS artifacts are deployed in production._

**Sample threat scenarios addressed by this job:**

- A critical vulnerability is discovered in log4j, and the incident response team wants to know all the production services using log4j so they can appropriately staff and coordinate a response effort

Once we have ingested and scanned the artifacts entering the software supply chain, we must ensure that we have an inventory whereeach artifact is used, by knowing in which services it is deployed and in which products it was released. This is required for incident response scenarios so that teams affected by a compromised package can be contacted so the appropriate actions can be taken to remove the affected package.

### _Practice 4: Update It_

_I can deploy updated external artifacts soon after an update becomes publicly available._

**Sample threat scenarios addressed by this job:**

- A team is currently using three different vulnerable NuGet packages and upgrading each package will be a substantial amount of work for the team. The team chooses to start by upgrading the most widely deployed package.

Once we have ingested, scanned, and inventoried whereeach artifact is used, we can enable developers to _fix_ issues with artifacts that have already been used by knowing the supply chain processes that released the product/service that needs the fix.

Given the [SaltStack incident](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/05/04/saltstack-salt-vulnerabilities/), where a vulnerability was exploited within 3 days after announcement, every organization should aspire to patch vulnerable OSS packages in under 72 hours so that you patch faster than the adversary can operate. Using tools such as Dependabot to auto-generate Pull Requests (PRs) to update vulnerable OSS become critical capabilities for securing your supply chain.

### _Practice 5: Audit It_

_I can prove that every OSS artifact in production has a full chain-of-custody from the original artifact source and is consumed through the official supply chain._

**Sample threat scenarios addressed by this job:**

- A well-meaning but misguided developer bypasses the official engineering pipeline to update an OSS package directly in a release; however, this new version contains a known vulnerability
- An attacker with network access intentionally bypasses the official engineering pipeline to deploy malware to a service

Now that we have ingested, scanned, inventoried, and provided the ability to update any artifact that has come through the software supply chain properly, you must have the ability within your organization to audit OSS consumption to see if it&#39;s coming through the standardized consumption tools (such as a package repository solution) established by your organization.

### _Practice 6: Enforce It_

_I can rely on secure and trusted OSS consumption within my organization._

**Sample threat scenarios addressed by this job:**

- A developer bypasses the official engineering pipeline to consume an OSS package with a known vulnerability

All OSS artifacts must be consumed from trusted sources and through the official OSS consumption channels. The next step is to enable enforcement of the supply chain so that all artifacts that in any way impact a production service/release must come through the full supply chain. An example of enforcement is to reroute DNS traffic or configure builds to break if they try to consume OSS from untrusted sources.

### _Practice 7: Rebuild It_

_I can rebuild from source code every OSS artifact I&#39;m deploying._

**Sample threat scenarios addressed by this job:**

- A team uses a malicious OSS package with a hidden backdoor (which could happen via traditional exploitation, political influence, blackmail or even threats of violence); as a result, the package&#39;s binaries do not match its source code.
- An attacker gains access to build infrastructure and modifies generated binaries during the build process; as a result, illicit changes can be injected in a manner that is essentially invisible to its original authors and users alike.

Until now, we have assumed that we took our inputs at the beginning of the supply chain _as-is_: as the package, container, or other delivery vehicle provided by the author. For key artifacts that are business-critical and for all artifacts that are inputs to High Value Assets, this assumption may not be sufficient. Hence, the next step to secure the supply chain is creating a chain of custody _from the original source code_ for every artifact used to create a production service/release.

The baseline REBUILD IT requirement is to enable developers who have a critical dependence on certain OSS components to ingest source code (including discovering the source code, which is not always linked to the built artifact), rebuild it (possibly developing build scripts along the way, if they&#39;re not part of the source code), make any post-build modifications (e.g. signing), cache the rebuilt artifact, and advertise the internally-rebuilt version&#39;s existence to other teams in the organization. One other potential method is the use of multiple third parties to build and come to consensus on a &#39;correct&#39; artifact (e.g. [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/)).

### _Practice 8: Fix It + Upstream_

_I can privately patch, build, and deploy any external artifact within 3 days of harm notification and confidentially contribute the fix to the upstream maintainer._

**Sample threat scenarios addressed by this job:**

- A team has taken a dependency on a package; the package is later discovered to have a critical vulnerability and the maintainer needs help/more time to fix the issue

**When To Use This:** _This is intended to be used only in extreme scenarios and for temporary risk mitigation. It should only be used when the upstream maintainer is unable to provide a public fix within an acceptable time for your Organization&#39;s risk tolerance. The first action any organization should take is to confidentially report the vulnerability to the upstream maintainer AND help suggest a fix_.

Once we can rebuild any artifact used in the software supply chain, the final step is to be able to privately fix it while confidentially disclosing the vulnerability to the upstream maintainer. Assuming that the team that ingested the source and rebuilt the artifact has allowed PRs to their forked copy of the source and set up CI builds appropriately, then anyone needing to private fix a component can use the normal PR workflow. The only additional work needed is the ability to distribute the private fix as widely within the organization as is needed.

Related to the note below, the implemented fix should be confidentially contributed to the upstream maintainer to give back to the community.


> **📝 Important Note**
>
> The Fix It + Upstream practice should not be perceived as being at odds with supporting communities and projects. If an organization chooses to take a dependency on open source, they should also find ways to give back to the community. Microsoft suggests a number of different ways to contribute:
> - Financial support and participating in foundations or even individual projects: [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors), [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/become-a-sponsor), etc.
> - Bounty programs (such as [SOS Rewards](https://sos.dev/)) and sharing best practices and tools with projects around security
> - Being present and participating in key open source projects to share fixes or expertise
> - See Microsoft's approach toward contributing to open source for more ideas [Microsoft&#39;s Open Source Program | Microsoft Open Source](https://opensource.microsoft.com/program#program-contributing)

# The OSS SSC Framework Implementation Guide

## Target Audience

This section details a maturity model, which splits the practices in the previous section into 4 levels to achieve. There is also a list of tools your organization can implement to meet each security level in the framework. The guidance is useful to software developers, Continuous Integration and Continuous Development (CI/CD) administrators, and security practitioners.

## OSS SSC Framework Levels of Maturity

When the OSS SSC Framework was first developed, the strategy to secure our OSS supply chain was comprised of 8 practices.

![](RackMultipart20220804-1-5ey4ri_html_e973b23c23843d9a.png)

Since all 8 practices cannot be reasonably implemented at the same time, the following maturity model organizes the requirements from each of the 8 practices into 4 different levels. It allows an organization to make incremental progress from their existing set of security capabilities toward a more secure defensive posture. Additionally, the maturity model considers different threats and themes at each Maturity Level.

![](RackMultipart20220804-1-5ey4ri_html_56706669f13edee1.png)

**Level 1** – Using a package caching solution, performing an OSS inventory, plus scanning and updating OSS represents the most common set of OSS security capabilities across the software industry today.

**Level 2** – This maturity level focuses on shifting security further left by improving ingestion configuration security, decreasing MTTR to patch OSS vulnerabilities, and responding to incidents. The SaltStack vulnerability in 2020 showed us that adversaries were able to start exploiting CVE-2020-11651 within 3 days of it being announced. Even though a patch was available, organizations were not able to patch their systems fast enough. Thus, a key component of this level leverages automation to help developers keep their OSS hygiene healthy and updated. The ideal goal is for organizations to be able to patch faster than attackers can operate.

**Level 3** – Proactively performing security analysis on your organization&#39;s most used OSS components and reducing risk to consume malicious packages are the themes of this maturity level. Scanning for malware in OSS before the package is downloaded is key toward preventing compromise. Then, to perform proactive security reviews of OSS requires that an organization can clone the source code to an internal location. Proactive security reviews help you look for the not-yet-discovered vulnerabilities, as well as identifying other threat categories such as detecting backdoors.

**Level 4** – Rebuilding OSS on trusted build infrastructure is a defensive step to ensure that the OSS was not compromised at build time. Build time attacks are performed by the most sophisticated adversaries and do not occur very frequently. Thus, this level of maturity is what&#39;s required to defend against the most sophisticated adversaries. Additionally, rebuilding OSS has many subtle technical challenges such as what to name the package to prevent collisions with upstream? How to make sure all developers use the internal package instead of the external? Rebuilding also enables you to implement fixes (if needed) and deploy them at scale across your organization.

## How to Assess Where Your Organization is in the Maturity Model?

Any maturity assessment should be done at the Organization level, so that it assesses multiple different OSS consumption processes from across different development teams. Some teams may have more mature processes than others, even within a single organization, so it&#39;s best to perform a company-wide assessment to determine OSS consumption practices across a diverse set of software development teams. The steps to perform a Maturity Assessment are below:

1. **Prepare for Assessment**. The first step is to understand the concepts behind the OSS SSC Framework so you feel comfortable engaging with developers and engineers to inquire about their existing tools, capabilities, and workflows. Next, identify a good sample size of diverse development teams from across the company to interview.
2. **Perform the Assessment**. This is where you assess the organization&#39;s degree of maturity in software developer OSS management, security, and consumption processes. Here are a set of example questions that you can ask:
    1. What type of OSS do you consume in your project?(e.g. native C/C++, NuGet, PyPI, npm, etc.)
    2. How are you consuming your OSS into your project? (e.g. Using a Package Cache solution such as Azure Artifacts, commands such as curl or git clone, checking in the OSS into the repo, etc.)
    3. Where do you consume your OSS from? (e.g. NuGet.org, npmjs.com, pypi.org, etc.)
    4. Do you use a mix of internal-only packages and external packages? (_This can make you susceptible to Dependency Confusion attacks_)
    5. Does your package source file (e.g. nuget.config, pom.xml, pip.conf, etc.) contain multiple feeds in its configuration? (_This can make you susceptible to Dependency Confusion attacks_)
    6. Do you do anything custom with how you consume OSS? (e.g. consuming private forks of projects, putting Golang components into a NuGet, etc.)
    7. Does your project use package lock files? (e.g. [packages.lock.json](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/enable-repeatable-package-restores-using-a-lock-file/) for NuGet, [package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-lock-json) for NPM, etc.)
    8. How does your team inventory the use of OSS within your project? What tools are used?
    9. How is your team made aware when a vulnerability exists in an OSS component? What tool is used?
    10. At what point in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) are OSS vulnerabilities surfaced? (e.g. after release? During build? As comments in PRs?)
    11. How fast is OSS updated to address known vulnerabilities? (e.g. what is the Mean Time To Remediate)
    12. Is updating OSS a manual or automated process? (e.g. using Dependabot)
    13. Do you perform integration tests of how your software interfaces with the dependencies you have to validate that there are no breaking changes?
    14. Do you scan OSS for malware prior to use?
    15. Is your team able to block ingestion of a known-bad/malicious package?
    16. Does your team clone open source code internally?
    17. Does your team perform any sort of security reviews or scans of OSS before using?
    18. Does your team contribute bug fixes back to the upstream OSS maintainer?
    19. Do you rebuild any of the open source internally?
    20. Do you have an incident response plan or playbook for reacting to an incident of consuming a malicious OSS component?

1. **Plan for Improvements.** Based on the interviews and answers you received from across your organization, you should be able to determine where you fall within the OSS SSC Framework Maturity Levels. It&#39;s possible that some teams may be ahead of others, so your focus should be on elevating all development teams to a specific Maturity Level. It&#39;s suggested that you accomplish this by driving standardization in both process and tooling across your software development teams for consuming OSS.

The OSS SSC Framework categorizes its requirements into maturity levels to better help you prioritize investments in improvements. Additionally, the OSS SSC Framework recommends tooling with specific capabilities that mitigates against the known supply chain threats, but you probably should make business decisions about which set of tools are right for your business and your security goals.

## OSS SSC Framework Tooling Availability

**Comprehensive Tooling available in v1.0 of the OSS SSC Framework:**

The guidance and tooling in this document are a combination of paid and free tools from both Microsoft and across the industry.

**Tooling available in future iterations of the OSS SSC Framework:**

In the future, Microsoft plans on releasing more tools to help organizations secure their software supply chain end-to-end.

## Implementing the OSS SSC Framework by Level

Below is a table of the OSS SSC Framework requirements with example tools from across the industry or detailed instructions to implement them, sorted by maturity level. Many of the tools referenced below are freely available and are listed as such. Some tools that are individually listed are available through a bundled offering, such as [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) (GHAS). We aren&#39;t specifically endorsing any tool or service, as they each have different strengths or weaknesses. We recommend performing a thorough evaluation before deciding on a specific solution, including tools not referenced in this document.

This table maps each Framework requirement to corresponding level and Framework practice. To see the full list of requirements and their benefits, please see the [_OSS SSC Framework Requirements_](#OSS-SSC-Framework-Requirements) earlier in this document.

# Conclusion

The goal of this paper is to provide a _simple_ framework for the pragmatic inclusion of secure OSS consumption practices in the software development process. It outlines a series of discrete, non-proprietary security development activities that when joined with effective process automation and maturation levels represent the steps necessary for an organization to objectively claim compliance with the Microsoft OSS SSC Framework as defined by the requirements identified in Level 3 of the OSS SSC Framework Maturity Model.

Level 4 of the Maturity Model has a high estimated cost to implement compared to the risk/reward, and therefore should be considered as an aspirational north star vision for your organization.
