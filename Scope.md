## Scope

The Open Source Software (OSS) Secure Supply Chain (SSC) Framework is split into two parts:
1. a solution-agonistic set of practices that can be applied to many different scenarios
2. a maturity model-based implementation guide with detailed requirements for consuming OSS

For the purposes of this Framework, we define OSS as any source code, language package, module, component, container, library, or binary that you can consume into your software project as a dependency that does not have a paid-support contract.

The guidance provided in this paper is targeted toward teams and organizations that do software development, that take a dependency on open source software, and that seek to improve the security of their software supply chain.

The OSS SSC Framework is focused on securely consuming OSS and makes an excellent bridge to other producer-focused supply chain security frameworks. This is complementary to all other frameworks to achieve and exceed compliance with NIST SSDF and the recent Cybersecurity Executive Order.
