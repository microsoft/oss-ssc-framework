<img alt="secure package icon" src="images/secure-package-icon.png" width=15%>

## Overview
This guide outlines and defines how to securely consume Open Source Software (OSS) dependencies into the developer’s workflow. This paper is split into two parts: a solution-agonistic set of practices and a maturity model-based implementation guide. Our Framework is targeted toward organizations that do software development, that take a dependency on open source software, and that seek to improve the security of their software supply chain. 

Our OSS Secure Supply Chain (SSC) Framework is complete with: 

* A high-level solution-agnostic set of practices 
* A detailed list of requirements 
* A list of real-world supply chain threats specific to OSS, and how our Framework requirements mitigates them 
* A maturity model-based implementation guide, with links to tools from across the industry 
* A process for assessing your organization’s maturity 
* A mapping of the Framework requirements to 6 other supply chain specifications
